{"name":"prepair","tagline":"Automatic repair of single polygons","body":"![](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/23t4p/t/prepairlogo.png)\r\n\r\n## What is prepair?\r\n\r\nprepair permits you to easily repair \"broken\" GIS polygons, and that according to the international standards ISO 19107. In brief, given a polygon stored in [WKT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text), it *automatically* repairs it and gives you back a valid WKT. Automated repair methods can be considered as interpreting ambiguous or ill-defined polygons and giving a coherent and clearly defined output.\r\n\r\nIt performs more or less the same as the new PostGIS 2.0's function [ST_MakeValid()](http://postgis.org/documentation/manual-svn/ST_MakeValid.html), but is several order of magnitude faster, scales better to massive polygons, and predicting its behaviour is simple (so one can guess how her polygons will be repaired).\r\n\r\nprepair is based on a constrained triangulation, and [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org) and [OGR](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/) are used.\r\n\r\nIt is available under a dual license scheme: [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and commercial. If you are interested in a commercial license, please contact [Ken Arroyo Ohori](mailto:g.a.k.arroyoohori@tudelft.nl).\r\n\r\n## All the details (or almost)\r\nDetails of how we automatically repair broken polygons, and what results you can expect, are available our [Agile 2012 paper](http://www.gdmc.nl/ledoux/pdfs/_12agile.pdf).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
